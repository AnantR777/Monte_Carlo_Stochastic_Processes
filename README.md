This project was completed as an extension to the drift/jump diffustion processes section of the COMP0043 Numerical Methods for Finance module at University College London.
It provides a Monte Carlo simulation of 10 different well-known stochastic processes and analyses of the statistical properties of these processes through detailed visualisations.
